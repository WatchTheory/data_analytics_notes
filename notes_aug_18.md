- Today, the professor went over Slide presentation of Excel 
   - making a new worksheet
   - cut information from dataset and pasting cell in new worksheet
   - Multiplation, Addition, Subtraction, Division of cells 
   - Sorting a columns and rows
   - slides will be available in the disco, in the resources folder

Introduction into Class
- discuss how git pull 
- show us what helix coding editor 
- The professor wanted to show us how his note were
  - what the professor normally tells us 
    - "This is not easy its not impossible either, its up to use to do the best we can and give yourself a chance."
    - "Taking notes is important, whatever i highligh,i re-write and put in my own word."

3. Go back and only read highlight. 
                

#### What the professor does now

2. Go back and only read highlight. 



#### Moving to Excel 
- Today, the professor went over Slide presentation of Excel 
   - making a new worksheet
   - cut information from dataset and pasting cell in new worksheet
   - Multiplation, Addition, Subtraction, Division of cells 
   - Sorting a columns and rows
   - slides will be available in the disco, in the resources folder



**In Class Assignment**
pick one dataset and create 5 subsets of that data, range from 1 to 50 at least 5 and 5 subsets and sort each subset, at least one numerical  and least 3 operating column pick sort out and write down difference, 

- [x] pick one dataset - check 
- [x] create 5 subsets of that data
- [x] range from 1 to 50 at least 5 of each 
- [x] needs to have at least one numerical and least 3 operating columns 
- [x] pick sort out and write down the difference between them
- [x] add, subtracking, multiplation, division


From the NYPD Arrest data Year-to-Year dataset 
 1. I took the first 50 entry of the dataset on the Sheet 1 and continue to get the next 50 to put on Sheet 2
 2. The difference between them would be the amount of charges in each Sheet, For example In sheet 4 has more Assult than burglary 


#### Preforming Live in Class
1. go find a dataset 
2.create a repository and add brief summary of the dataset in Readme file.
3. create a =="data"== folder
4. copy the address, navigate to codingpro folder in Documents in windows terminal 
5.  type ==git clone {paste address here}==
6. Once it finishes move the dataset to the Google drive and make a new folder in ==CTProject==
7. Open a new ==Google Colab file== in that new folder
8. Connect GDrive to the Colab, 
9. Add python code to the file and when do, find ==Save file in Github==
