#### Mean
The mean is the average of a dataset, calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the number of observations.

Key Point : heavily influenced by **outliers**(extremely high or low values), which may distort its representation of the dataset. 



#### Medium
 is the middle value of a dataset when it is sorted in ascending order. It effectively represents the central point, especially in datasets with skewed distributions or outliers.
 Own Word : 

 

Key Point :  The median is a robust measure that is not affected by outliers, making it particularly useful for analyzing skewed datasets.



Mode 
is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is especially useful in categorical data analysis, where we want to identify the most common category.


Key Point : There can be multiple modes (bimodal or multimodal) or no mode at all if all values occur with equal frequency.


Mean: Ideal for symmetrical distributions without outliers, as it represents an accurate average.
Median: Best for skewed distributions or datasets with outliers, since it captures the center without being distorted by extreme values.
Mode: Useful for categorical data or to pinpoint the most frequently occurring value, especially in non-numeric datasets.
