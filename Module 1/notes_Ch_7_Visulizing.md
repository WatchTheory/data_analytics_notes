Difference between histogram vs Box Plot

Data visualization enhances understanding by revealing hidden patterns, outliers, and simplifying complex datasets, facilitating better decision-making. Essential tools like frequency distributions and boxplots are crucial for this purpose. Frequency distributions, including bar charts and histograms, summarize how often specific values or categories appear in data. Bar charts visualize categorical data frequencies, while histograms depict the distribution of numerical data across intervals. Boxplots, or box-and-whisker plots, graphically summarize a dataset's distribution, showing central tendency, spread, and potential outliers. These tools collectively help uncover insights and trends within data.
