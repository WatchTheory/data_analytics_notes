Define and calculate percentiles and quartiles in a dataset.
Compute and interpret range, variance, and standard deviation.
Analyze the implications of measures of dispersion on data variability.
Compare and contrast the use of different measures of position and dispersion.
Apply statistical concepts to real-world scenarios for informed decision-making.


Measures of position are crucial for understanding how individual values relate to the entire dataset.

#### Peercentiles
A percentile is a statistical measure that indicates the value below which a certain percentage of observations fall within a dataset.

#### Quartiles
divide your data into four equal parts, helping you understand its spread and distribution. Each quartile represents a specific percentile, making it easy to identify how data points are distributed across different ranges.

### Summary 
In summary, percentiles and quartiles are essential tools for understanding the distribution of data within a dataset. Percentiles allow us to determine the relative standing of a specific value, indicating what percentage of the dataset lies below it. This is particularly useful for comparing individual observations within the context of the whole group. Quartiles, on the other hand, divide the data into four equal parts, providing a clearer picture of how data is spread and highlighting key thresholds, such as the median. Together, these statistical measures empower you to interpret and analyze data effectively, enabling informed decision-making in various fields, from academic research to business analytics.



#### Measures of Dispersion
Range, variance, and standard deviation are powerful tools that help us understand the variability and distribution of data within a dataset.
