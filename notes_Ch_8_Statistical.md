Grasp the fundamental concept of probability.
Gain insight into how probability distributions depict the likelihood of various outcomes in a dataset.
Become familiar with the bell-shaped curve of the normal distribution.
Understand the basics of hypothesis testing and the step-by-step process it entails. 

Introduction to Probability




Probability Distribuation
help us understand the likelihood of different outcomes within a dataset.


Normal Distribution
shows how data is spread around an average value, resembling a bell-shaped curve, with its peak at the mean and width determined by data variability.



Hypothesis Testing
Define the Question 
Formulate the hypothese
Collect the Data
Perform a Statistical test
Finding the P-Value & make a decision

In this lesson, we covered probability, the normal distribution's bell-shaped curve, and the basics of hypothesis testing. These skills form a solid foundation for delving deeper into the field of statistical inference. Whether you're analyzing data, making decisions, or contemplating probabilities, these concepts offer a logical and insightful perspective. In the next lesson, we'll explore understanding relationships between variables, and we'll dive more into hypothesis testing in future modules.
