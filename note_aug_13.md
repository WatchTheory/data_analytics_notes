## Lesson 2 : The data Analytics Cycle
 Ask a question     --- > gather data to answer question  - Q: What drives an interests  


- Understand the data analysis process, recognizing its key phases from problem definition through data collection, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation/communication of insights, and appreciate the significance of each phase in achieving meaningful outcomes.
- Recognize the critical role of context in accurately interpreting data.
- Gain knowledge about data quality dimensions, including accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, and validity.
- Comprehend the significance of biased and unbiased data in analysis.
- Explore ethical considerations in data analysis, such as privacy protection, informed consent, fairness, transparency, data security, and social impact.



**Develop Question --> Collect Data --> Prep The Data --> Analyze Data --> Present Results**

1. **Develop Question** 
	1. SMART Framework 
		1. Specific : Formulate precise and well defined statement
		2. Measurable - Determine how you will evaluate project success
		3. Achievable - Ensure the project goals are realistic and attainable
		4. Relevant - Align the project with broader objectives
		5. Time-bound  - Establish clear deadlines for project completion
2. **Collect Data** 
	1. Using 3 methods of common sources 
		1. Database : Structured collection of data
		2. Spreadsheets Files : grid based files(similar to MS Excel)
		3. Text Files : containing text including comma-separated values (csv) and plan text (txt)
3. **Prep The Data**
	1. Data Cleaning or Data wrangling  :
		1. identification and correction of errors, inconsistencies or missing values within collected data.
	2. "Garbage in, garbage out" :
		1. emphasize the importance of thorough data cleaning to ensure the reliability of results.
4. **Analyze Data**
	1. Engaging in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
		1. A method that encompasses a through visual and statistical exploration of the data to depend the understanding of its characteristics
	2. Process generating summary statistics, visualization, and graphs to uncover patterns and relationship.
5. **Present Results**
	1. Data Analysts refine insights and effectively communicate to stakeholders
	2. CLEAR Approach
		1. C - Communicate Tailored Messages : 
			1. Communicate findings using accessible languages and tailor messages based on the audience's background & needs
		2. L - Leverage Visual Impact and Engagement :
			1. Use impactful visualizations and charts for clarity and memorability
			2. Forster engagement through interactive methods
		3. E - Emphasize Actionable Insights :
			1. Highlight how the result aligns with the objectives of the project
			2. Give actionable insights for practical decision-making
		4. A - Adhere to Time : 
			3. Respect time limits for presentations by structuring content accordingly
		5. R -Remember to Maintain a Rhythm : 
			5. Keep your audience engaged.
				1.Get to the point!


- helped Charles rebuild repository

To clone reposity
- navigate to repository you want clone
- Find "Code" > click the drop down arrow
- Copy the HTTP Address 
- Naviote to Temerial App > navigate to the folder you want to want on github 
- Enter "git clone " then paste the address it should look like this, without username > " git clone https://github.com/{username}/repository"



## Summarize of the Day
- Describe your experience in a few sentences
- Quick summary or "feedback" on Summarize note
- You are developing your own workflow


summary 
{Lab} -  making the folders in the termial was easy, from my time using Raspberry Pi OS using linux termial commands, gave me a step-up in knowing what to do. Using ls, cd, mkdir, cd.. to navitgate the temerial.
