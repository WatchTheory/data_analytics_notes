## Lesson 3 : Exploring Data Definitions


**Dataset** 
- a collection of data either strucuted or unstructure data
  - with variety types of data
    - numbers
     - text 
      - images

**Structured dataset**
- organized in well defined format in table format defined rows & columns


**Unstructured Datasets**
- lacks prefefined formats with no strucuture,
    - includes
      - text 
       - image
      - audio

**Datasets Formats**
- Dataset organized in two differnt formats WIDE & LONG being twon common structures.
- wide Format
    - more rows with few columns
- Long Format 
    - few columns and more rows



**Qualitiative data**
- obtaining non-numerical information used to describe qualities, characteristics and experience
   - Data Types
     - Nominal Data
       - Categories without any order, inherent ranking
     - Ordinal Data
        


Question 
  - How would you go about viewing unstructure data?

**Quantitative data**
- data that can be counted or measure, is expressed using numerial value
  - seems more scientistic driven
  - data types 
    


**Understanding the Difference data type**
- Obtaining data/insight from Qualitative data while your identify trends, patterns & relationship from Quantitative data



**Lesson 3 Summary**

In this lesson, we explored the essential concepts of data analysis, focusing on the various types of datasets and dataâ€”structured, unstructured, qualitative, and quantitative. By understanding the characteristics and formats of these datasets, as well as their distinctions, you are now better equipped to apply appropriate analytical techniques and derive meaningful insights. Mastering these foundational concepts will empower you to effectively navigate the data landscape, enhancing your ability to make informed decisions and unlock the stories hidden within your data. Keep building on this knowledge as you continue your journey in data analysis! ðŸ“Šâœ¨
