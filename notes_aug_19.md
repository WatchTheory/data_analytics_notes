Ahead of the course 

end-to-end project 

instruction 
- create one project  
- readme brief paragraphs 
    - your asking asking question
    -   think of it as an introduction
- find a dataset




where you got the data
what you choose
why you choose the dataset
what do you want to know

think detail of a book


more detailed expereince 
you want to get to what the data is telling 
data source 

where did data come from, not responsible for where it comes from

continue project you will be graded 
goal - building up your porofilo 

When you go into a interview - its your time...

story - what did you find out 

- every story has begining and end
- begining what do you want to find out
- body graphic, code, sql, technique, in order answer question, visulization, 
  the story progress from answer question.
- conclusion - according to these story ....


### Chapter 7: Visualizing Data Distribuations
dose it matter
yes and no 
  - you have to convey complex information into easy to understand 
    - ask your self: 
  - yes 
    - you can't betray the data, the bar graphic 
    - don't betray what your say..you have to 
    - pick a simple chart to display the informatioin
    - 


    -box plot give analytic persecption 
    - not about the right chart, about the story, sotry is only side, other side is about the data
    - using the varity of chart to convay your point

    - its about the tools 
    - teaching you how to be a shark. 

### Chapter 8 

Statistical Inference 
define 0 and 1 

think about this way : Tatw 

- computer science is either x or y 
- happening on 1 or something not happening 0 
 - how we define those vablues 0.5 under and 0.5 over 
 - either 1 or 0 of toss a coin 
 - 

 Talk about warhammer
 break 

 noted 
  it will depend, what is causeing, doesn't mean is normal, doesn't means its common. 
  why - most case is the normal event(spread of time) happens 
    dice apprears more time the dice has been throw

 gerneral speaking - where to proceed
  why ?  - gives you a refence point (give a porting)

  serect best-fit line
  
  m = slope 
  number = coverantor



   finding slope of the line
   what line has the best chance, unforim between avages and

   distance between two point (x,y)
   difference in machine learning y=mx+b is a matrix 
    - use to it being a variable 
    - its a martix 



concepts in class 
fresh in your mind
- system in mind 
- don't have systems, going to be loss in the course
   - setup notes
        - repository of notes  so to continue to learn
            - going to have lots steps(only add complexity)
- the point 
    - to have a system


Excel Assignment 
- [x] Create 5 different graphs from the 5 different subsets from [notes_aug_12] 

data processing or data engineering
- how to intera
- how to visualize the data
- create better charts
- model the data in a way to further write a story 
-

think about 
- create subsets and 
- 

Task 
what you did
why did you do it


tomorrow 
- closing out module 1 
    - okay to start working on project
