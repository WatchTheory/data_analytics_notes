What happen in class Today?


#### What the professor said during class
   - "Ahead of the course, we will be completelying an  end-to-end project"
   - **"Question to ask yourself when looking for dataset"**
      -  where you got the data
      - what you choose
      - why did you choose that dataset
      - what do you want to know
  - "where did data come from, not responsible for where it comes from"
  - Data Analyst Tips
      - "you want to get to what the data is telling"
  - Goal/Talk for the course
      - From this point onwards   ---- > ==continue project you will be graded==
      - "building up your porofilo"
      - "When you go into a interview - <u>"its your time, break out the popcorn, here is the story</u>"
  - Question!
      - What is the point of...
      - "It's about the story your telling"
          - "what did you find out"
      - every story has begining and end
      - begining what do you want to find out
      - body graphic, code, sql, technique, in order answer question, visulization 
      - the story progress from   answer question.
      - conclusion - according to these story .... x and y happen"
  - "As the course progress, it will get more complex, you will need to rely on your System of Notes to remember whats going on, whats happening"

#### Instruction for In-class assignment
1. go find a dataset from sources (Data.gov, kaggle,etc)
2. create a repository in Github
  a.readme brief paragraphs 
    - your asking asking question "Why"
    - think of it breif paragraph as an introduction 
      - "what do you when you walk in a book store and see a book"
        - You read the book introduction
3. Don't forget to add the ReadMe File to the repository
4. Create a =="data"== <u>folder for the dataset</u>
5. Copy the address, navigate to codingpro folder in Documents in windows terminal
6. Type ==git clone {paste address here}==
7. Upload the dataset to the data folder, via click-and-drag method
8. Once it finishes move the dataset to the Google drive and make a new folder in ==CTProject==
    - name the new folder, the name of the dataset
9. Open a new ==Google Colab file== in that new folder
10. Connect GDrive to the Colab
11. On The menu bar in Google colab > Click File > Find ==Save file in Github==

##### ==Note to Self==
  There is nothing as a stupid question in class




## Chapter 7: Visualizing Data Distribuations

<u>Question : dose it matter which graphs you use? </u>
  yes and no 
  - you have to convey complex information into easy to understand graphs, for people to easy not think about wha the information
    - ask your self?
  - Question : yes 
    - "you can't betray the data, the bar graphic" 
    - "don't betray what your say..you have to"
    - "pick a simple chart to display the informatioin"
  - Other information about Chapter 7
    - "box plot give analytic persecption"
    - "not about the right chart, about the story, sotry is only side, other side is about the data"
    - "using the varity of chart to convay your point"
    - "its about the tools"
    - "I am teaching you how to be a shark."

## Chapter 8 : Statistical Inference

Statistical Inference 
define as either 0 and 1 

Think about this way - Think This Way
- computer science is either x or y, 0 or 1, true or false
- happening on 1 or something not happening 0 
 - "how we define those vablues 0.5 under and 0.5 over"
 - "either 1 or 0 of toss a coin"

Topic of Chapter 8:
  - it will depend, what is causeing, doesn't mean is normal, doesn't means its common. 
  - why - most case is the normal event(spread of time) happens 
    - dice apprears more time the dice has been throw
  - gerneral speaking 
      - where to proceed
          - Why - gives you a refence point (give a porting)
  - Simple Linear Regression
    - serect for the best-fit line model
        - m =   slope
        - x = 
        - number = coverantor
        - b  =  
    - finding slope of the line
    - what line has the best chance, unforim between avages and...
  - distance between two point (x,y)
  - difference in machine learning 
      - y=mx+b 
          - is a matrix 
    - "Use to it being a variable now its a martix"



concepts in class 
Professor Advice to fresh in your mind
- system in mind 
- don't have systems, going to be loss in the course
   - setup notes
        - repository of notes  so to continue to learn
            - "going to have lots steps(only add complexity)"
- the point 
    - to have a system



### Introduction to making graphs in class


Excel Assignment 
- [x] Create 5 different graphs from the 5 different subsets from [notes_aug_12] 


Different names for what we are doing in...
- data processing or 
- data engineering
- Other Topic
    - how to visualize the data
    - create better charts
    - model the data in a way to further write a story 




Questions to ask when reviewing notes : 
- "What you did"
- "Why did you do it"
-  How did you do it



### Looking Ahead
Tomorrow 
- closing out module 1 
    - okay to start working on project
